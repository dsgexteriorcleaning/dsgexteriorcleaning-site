    <h1>About DSG Exterior Cleaning</h1>
    <p>
      DSG Exterior Cleaning was built on a simple idea: exterior cleaning should protect your home,
      not put it at risk.

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Many exterior cleaning companies focus on speed and volume. We take a different approach.
      Every surface, material, and home is treated individually — with the right method, pressure,
      and products for the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means soft washing where low pressure is required, pressure washing only where appropriate,
      and professional window and gutter cleaning performed with safety and care.

    <h2>Professional, Safety-First Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Our technicians follow clear procedures designed to protect siding, roofing, landscaping,
      and surrounding property. We do not cut corners, rush jobs, or use excessive pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach leads to better results, longer-lasting cleanliness, and peace of mind for
      homeowners.
